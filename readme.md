# python

Learning Python!  Interesting language with data manipulation basically baked in.

The python tutorials and docs are solid for learning the language structure, flow and built-in libs
https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#module-dataclasses

for more practical stuff like networking etc

Concepts to learn using python:

* jupyter notebooks

* generic vector math - numpy

* machine learning

* AI - 

# Jupyter Notebook

parts

* lab

* notebook


https://jupyter.org/install


Each of these are webbased and install globally by default.

pip install jupyterlab

launch:
jupyter lab

pip install notebook

launch:
jypyter notebook

pip install voila

lauch: 
voila

## Lab


## Notebook

## voila

viewer/renderer for notebooks.

has launch links from within notebook and lab

# usage stuff

user docs - hard to find in the main site...

## running in folder environments

By default python runs and installs things machine wide.  This is not really great for development of notebooks or other things which you may want to upgrade separately (common libs upgrade common and that can cause one module to fail when another module is upgraded)

Use virtual envs ... 

python -m venv myenv 

creates the environment in your current folder instead of in your user profile.

> NOTE: vscode python plugin facilitates this but below describes how to switch and manage envs.

switching envs

activate 

```ps1
# from folder - ps1
./myenv/Scripts/Activate
```

vscode will show the env on the command prompt in brackets
  (myenv) PS C:\files\dev\python-play\jupyter>
